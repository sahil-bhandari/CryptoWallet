		2) https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/symbio/id1497548813

I believe that while implementing some features in these apps were challenging and these challenges helped me learn new skills.


  b. How would you handle this situation?
     The Product Owner comes over to you and asks for an implementation with which he can see the performance of his crypto wallet over the past weeks. He is an iOS user and doesn't know the Android platform too well. How would you approach this task?

Reply:
	I will present him historical data of his crypto coin on website (example: https://in.investing.com/crypto/bitpanda-ecosystem-token/chart) and help him visualise the performance utilizing the above information. Even now if he needs an implementation then I would have discussed with him to make a prototype for Android platform or a power-point presentation. To incase a prototype was developed then I would have explained him using terms similar to an iOS user as per my experience in xamarin native.


  c. What kind of (technical) projects do you work on in your spare time?

Reply: 
	In my spare time I like to research and look into IoT related projects and technologies. I even try out new libraries and sdk's released by Android in order to be familiar with new technologies in my field.
